# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'
api/.env

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
api/log/**
api/tmp/**
!api/log/.keep
!api/tmp/.keep

# Ignore uploaded files in development
api/storage/*
!api/storage/.keep

/.idea

api/public/assets

# Ignore master key for decrypting credentials and more.
/config/master.key
