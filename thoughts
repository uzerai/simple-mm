Thoughts on the simple-mm project, a simple matchmaking/elo rating system:

- I've already readied parts of it; but I'm going ahead with using actioncable for the websocket implementation so that players can be notified when their match is ready for certain 
games. This is probably mostly going to be for the active games where you're expecting a match to be assembled within 10-15 minutes at most rating levels (think chess, video games, etc)

- One thing I really want to do is have the support for physical games, and the support for stuff like organizing your own local leagues which are persistent over longer periods of time.
Best and coolest thing would be to integrate with calendars so that players in smaller tight-knit communities could organize a match beforehand and send out notifications to where and when the match will be played (maybe email? idk)

- Definitely want support for all kinds of games, game types and matchmaking types (physical/digital/all modes)

- This would also include pick-player game modes, so two players are chosen as captain when a match is made with a select pool of players withing a matchmaking range.

- Would also be cool to be able to automatically pick the most balanced teams.

- Can imagine details (location/time) of physical games would require some additional auth, but I think offloading that to a designated matchmaker who would fill this in on another platform (such as the afroementioned calendar).

- Customizable matchmaking weights depending on the amount of players within a league? Could maybe do some statistical analysis of the league with some set interval which would adjust the maximum and minimum gains per player possible? Achieving a bell-curve balance of ratings within a league would be best only in large groups; in smaller groups, ensuring a much shorter range of ratings would be preferable. This value could maybe be visible on the league/community/whatever I'll name it.

- Public and private leagues denoted by geographical area for physical games? Maybe even include it as a possible setting for online games too (think LAN)?

- Mobile phone native support for push notifications via the web push api, maybe even perhaps explore technologies around web-workers where it could be fun to remind players about maybe filling in the score for a game or something?

- Maybe entirely unrated matchmaking leagues and systems, especially in tournament formats.


-- ULTIMATELY: For now lets focus on games which are much easier to bring people together over; namely digital games.

- AI? I'd have to sit down and really come to understand the term and the limits of what machines are capable of, but if the project sees some moderate use and a sizable dataset would emerge from its use, I think I would really enjoy attempting to employ AI-assisted modification of rating gain/loss to maintain viability of _any_ possible team in a league.
